This project was a school assignment done in December 2025 using Microsoft Access. The making process took around 3 - 4 weeks. The database was created in Bulgarian, but hopefully the following README file will help you understand how to use it. 
1. Getting to know the idea
   
Dear user, 

In this file you will find information and clear instructions on how to use the personal finance management database we created. The idea of ​​this project is to help you allocate your finances, to be able to track your income, expenses and savings every month.

2. Home Screen
   
The Home Screen is the first thing you should open. The blue buttons on the left half of the screen will give you access to the screens:
• My Data & Goals

• Expenses

• Expense Categories

• Expense Subcategories

• Car Expenses

• Financial Goals

• Salary %

On the right side of the screen is a field where you can see the total amount of expenses you have had so far for the month. Below that, the database will automatically calculate how much money is left from your salary, subtracting the expenses.

3. Car Costs

This screen is where you enter information about the car. The Future Repairs and Contingencies fields are automatically calculated by the program after you enter the car cost. The buttons are used to navigate between entries, delete, and save the information.

4. My data and goals

The "My data and goals" screen is used to save your user information.
Enter your personal identification number, name and gross salary. The program will automatically calculate your insurance, taxes and net salary. Then enter your goal and select your car registration number from the drop-down menu.

The buttons at the bottom perform the following functions:

• The leftmost button takes you to previous entries

• The next one deletes the information entered on the screen

• The middle button is pressed to save the information entered

• The rightmost button takes you to a blank form where you can enter information for a new user

5. Expense categories

On this screen you can enter different categories of expenses such as household, entertainment, car and others.
The leftmost and rightmost buttons help you switch between the different categories. The second button deletes the recorded information, and the third button saves it.

6. Expense subcategories

Here you can enter subcategories to the above categories as shown in the example. The buttons on this screen work the same as those on the previous one.

7. Expenses
